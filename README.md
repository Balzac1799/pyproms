PyProms
=======

PyProms is a library of functions that helps Python coders generate
provenance reports for their scripts using the PROV and PROMS Ontologies.
It also has a function to send a Report to and instances of the PROMS
Server.

Within the library are a series of classes that match the PROMS-O OWL
classes, for example the Python class Report matches the PROMS-O Report
class.

PyProms is expected to be extended so if you need so add to it to get your
reporting job done, please do so! If you're really nice, you might consider
letting the author, Nicholas Car <nicholas.car@csiro.au> know what you've
added as this will help with further releases.
